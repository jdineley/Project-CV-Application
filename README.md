This application is an extension of the great application written by michalosman

I added a theme change with local storage data persistance.

The reason I used a finish application as the basis for this was my lack of experience with styled components, which was used by michalosman.  This has been a great springboard for developing ability with styled components.

From the start my ambition was to implement style selection.  Initially I began writing the application from scratch and implemented the react logic relatively easily.  The struggle started when I wanted to dynamically change the layout.  After some research, including looking at lazy import of CSS files, it become clear that there wasn't a quick fix for my problem.  Learning styled components allowed for the implementation.  The various layouts are captured in a layoutConfig file.

Have a play and see what you think.
